CMacIonize now has an official project website. The current website 
contains a minimal amount of information about the code, a complete list 
of publications that used the code (more to follow soon!) and a mostly 
empty gallery that contains images (and in the future maybe also 
movies).

The new website is hosted on the [Github 
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) of the CMacIonize repository, and is 
stored in a separate `gh-pages` branch. It consists of static pages 
generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that are automatically 
updated whenever new content is pushed to the online repository.

The plan is to store all initial conditions for published CMacIonize 
simulations on this website, as well as the main results from these 
simulations. There are also plans to extend the website with a set of 
tutorials that show how to run and extend the code, and how to use it as 
an external library. We are still working on the implementation of these 
features at the moment.

Since the webpage is hosted inside the CMacIonize github repository, we 
can only store a limited amount of images and movies. We are also 
looking into alternatives to increase our storage capacity.
