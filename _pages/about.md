CMacIonize is a public Monte Carlo Radiation Hydrodynamics (MCRHD) code 
that is the result of a merger of two other codes: Kenneth Wood's 
(unnamed) [Monte Carlo radiation transfer 
code](http://www-star.st-and.ac.uk/~kw25/research/montecarlo/ionize/ionize.html) 
([Wood et al., 2004](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.348.1337W)) 
and Bert Vandenbroucke's moving-mesh code 
[Shadowfax](http://ascl.net/1605.003) ([Vandenbroucke & De 
Rijcke](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26C....16..109V)). The code 
can be used to self-consistently study the dynamics of the interstellar 
medium surrounding one or multiple sources of ionising radiation.

The code is completely open-source (and has been since day 1), and can 
be downloaded from the [CMacIonize github 
repository](https://github.com/bwvdnbro/CMacIonize). When using the code 
for your own research, please cite the original [code 
paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....23...40V):

Some journals also allow you to cite the [CMacIonize entry in the 
Astrophysical Source Code Library](http://ascl.net/1802.003):
