      Expanding HII regions at the start of a self-consistent RHD 
      simulation of the evolution of the Diffuse Ionised Gas (DIG) in disc 
      galaxies (Vandenbroucke &amp; Wood, 2019)

      D-type expansion of an HII region surrounding a massive O star 
      that is accreting through a Bondi-like accretion torus (Sartorio et al., 
      2019)

      HII region surrounding a massive O star that is accreting through 
      a spherically symmetric Bondi accretion flow. Simulated using 
      self-consistent 3D RHD simulations using two different grid types. 
      This simulation illustrates the asymmetries caused in a self-consistent 
      3D treatment of this problem due to the marginal stability of the 
      two-temperature Bondi accretion solution (Vandenbroucke et al., 2019)

      Shared memory execution time line for a StrÃ¶mgren benchmark
      test on 4 threads, showing the excellent load-balancing of the 
      task-based shared memory parallelization strategy (Vandenbroucke & Wood, 
      2018).
