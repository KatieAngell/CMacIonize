 * A task context is responsible for storing all variables that are required
 * for the execution of a specific task type. It shall provide an execute()
 * function that receives a task and executes it. The task context stores all
 * variables that are shared among the threads; if a task requires thread-local
 * variables, these should be stored in a dedicated ThreadContext.
